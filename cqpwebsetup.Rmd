# Introduction {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

If you are reading this, you probably come from the [SaCoCo tutorial](index.html), you have access to a CQPweb installation as administrator, and you want to encode the corpus. We document below two approaches:

1. advanced
1. "easy"

The first approach is more involved, but allows for much more control and freedom. The second might be helpful, specially if you are a beginner, and the annotation of your corpus is pretty basic.

## Advanced

Let's assume that you have:

- `cqp` installed in your computer
- administrator access to a CQPweb installation
- root access to the server where the CQPweb lives

### Encode the corpus for the CWB

The first thing we need to do is to encode the corpus. This process will create a number of files that will enable to use the CQP language to query the corpus.

Once we have the texts in VRT format, encoding the corpus for the CWB is relatively easy.

Check that you have the corpus work bench installed in the computer, if not, download it and follow these [instructions](http://cwb.sourceforge.net/download.php). We compiled from source version 3.4.8.

Now, run the following commands:

```bash
# create the target folder for encoded data
mkdir -p data/cqp/data
# run the command
cwb-encode -c utf8 -d data/cqp/data -F data/contemporary/meta/ -F data/historical/meta -R data/cqp/sacoco -xsB -S text:0+id+collection+source+year+decade+period+title -S p:0 -S s:0 -P pos -P lemma -P norm
# generate the registry file
cwb-make -r data/cqp -V SACOCO
```

The `cwb-encode`'s parameters explained:

- `-c` to the declare the character encoding
- `-d` path to the target directory were the output will be stored
- `-F` path to the input directory were the VRT files are located
- `-R` path to the registry file
- `-xsB`
    - `x` for XML compatibility mode (recognises default entities and
skips comments as well as an XML declaration)
    - `s` to skip blank lines in the input
    - `B` to strip whitespace from tokens
- `-S` to declare a structural attribute, example:
    - `-S text:0+id+authors/`
    - `text`, structural attribute to be declared
    - `0` embedding levels
    - `id` will be an attribute of `text` containing some value
- `-P` to declare positional attributes

Get extensive information on how to encode corpora for the CWB in the [encoding tutorial](http://cwb.sourceforge.net/files/CWB_Encoding_Tutorial.pdf).

> TIP: for development/testing purposes, just run the command below on the test files.

```bash
# create the target folder for encoded data
mkdir -p test/cqp/data
# run the command
cwb-encode -c utf8 -d test/cqp/data -F test/contemporary/meta/ -F test/historical/meta -R test/cqp/sacoco -xsB -S text:0+id+collection+source+year+decade+period+title -S p:0 -S s:0 -P pos -P lemma -P norm
# generate the registry file
cwb-make -r test/cqp -V SACOCO
```

### Upload the corpus to the server and set permissions

Once you have the data you have to upload the file to the server where CQPweb is installed. In our case is the machine `fedora.clarin-d.uni-saarland.de`.

In our case, one needs to connet to the server as `root` user. There are different methods to upload the files:

- via the command line with tools like `scp` or `rsync` which use the `ssh` protocol
- via a FTP client like [Filezilla](https://filezilla-project.org)

Upload the local folder `data/cqp/sacoco/` to the remote folder (in the server) `/data2/cqpweb/indexed`, and the registry file `data/cqp/sacoco` to the folder `/data2/cqpweb/registry`.

Once all files are uploaded, you have to check the ownership of the folder/file:

- the owner should be `wwwrun`
- the group should be `www`

If not just run a couple of commands:

```bash
chown -R wwwrun:www /data2/cqpweb/indexed/sacoco
chown wwwrun:www /data2/cqpweb/registry/sacoco
```

Then, modify the registry file `/data2/cqpweb/registry/sacoco` to indicate the location of the corpus in the server `/data2/cqpweb/indexed/sacoco`.

### Log in as admin in CQPweb

1. Type the URL to your CQPweb installation (e.g. <https://fedora.clarin-d.uni-saarland.de/cqpweb/>)
1. log in with an administrator account, you are redirected to your user account
1. click on `Go to admin control panel` in the lefthand menu **Account actions**.

### Installing the corpus

We can now start installing the corpus:

1. click on `Install a new corpus` in the left menu **Corpora**
1. click on the link `Click here to install a corpus you have already indexed in CWB.` which you will find in the grey row at the top of the page.
1. Fill in the fields
    1. Specify a MySQL name for this corpus: `sacoco`
    1. Enter the full name of the corpus: `Saarbrücken Cookbook Corpus`
    1. Specify the CWB name (lowercase format): `sacoco`
1. Click on the button `Install corpus with settings above` that you will find at the bottom of the page.


A new page will load:

1. click on `Design and insert a text-metadata table for the corpus`

A new page will load:

1. Choose `sacoco.meta` in section `Choose the file containing the metadata`
1. Fill in the field rows in `Describe the contents of the file you have selected`, providing for *Handle* and *Description*:
    1. year
    1. decade
    1. period
    1. collection
    1. source
    1. title
1. Mark `collection` as the primary category.
1. Set `title` as free text
1. Select `Yes please` in section `Do you want to automatically run frequency-list setup?`
1. Finally, click on the button `install metadata table using the settings above`

Now set up the annotation (positional attributes):

1. click on `Manage annotation`, you will find it in the left menu, in section `Admin Tools`.
1. complete the annotation metadata information at the bottom:
    1. lemma: *Description:* lemma
    1. click on `Go!`
    1. pos: *Description:* pos; *Tagset name:* STTS; *External URL:* <http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/forschung/ressourcen/lexika/TagSets/stts-table.html>
    1. click on `Go!`
    1. norm: *Description* norm; *External URL:* <http://www.deutschestextarchiv.de/doku/software#cab>
    1. click on `Go!`
    1. set `pos` as `Primary annotation` above
    1. click on `Update annotation settings`.


Check corpus settings:

1. go to `Corpus settings` in `Admin tools`
1. in `General options`:
    1. assign a category in field `The corpus is currently in the following category:` Historical corpora
    1. click on the `Update` button
    1. provide an external URL: <http://hdl.handle.net/11858/00-246C-0000-001F-7C43-1>
    1. clik on the `Update` button

We set the access to this corpus open for everybody:

1. go to `Admin Control Panel` in `Admin tools`
1. go to `Manage privileges` in `Users and privileges`
1. scroll to the bottom of the page, there
    1. select `sacoco` from list `Generate default privileges for corpus...`
    1. click on button `Generate default privileges for this corpus`.
1. go to `Manage group grants` in `Users and privileges`
    1. scroll to the bottom, in section `Grant new privilege to group`
    1. Select group `everybody`
    1. Select a privilege `Normal access privilege for corpus [sacoco]`
    1. click on `Grant privilege to group!`

Hurraaaaah! Corpus ready to be queried!
